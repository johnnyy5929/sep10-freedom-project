## Choosing a topic
Choosing the topic was the hardest part. There was many topices to chooce from like sports, travel and trading goods. However the most intersting was cooking, so I decided for this year long project I will be researching about cooking and make a webiste about cooking. During the summer I was spending time cooking and baking and founded it really fun and enjoy the expience of cooking and banking. When I was reserching for this year-long project I found many intersting article and webiste mostly about cooking and banking. Some of these article and website are ["Why is cooking imortant"](https://sushantuniversity.edu.in/blog/the-importance-of-cooking-as-a-life-skill/#:~:text=Preparing%20fresh%20foods%20will%20put,of%20your%20family%20and%20friends.)by Sushant, ["Benefits of cooking at home"](https://www.liketocook.com/benefits-of-cooking/) by LikeToCook.com. Both of these article were intersting on why cooking is important however the article called ["The importance of Cooking"](https://dailyutahchronicle.com/2017/01/16/the-importance-of-cooking/) by The daily utah chronicle. Seeing all the ways that cooking is important I choose to making a website about it. On the way I am learning many skills.
