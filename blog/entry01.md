# Entry 1:Deciding on My Topic
##### 10/23/23
## Choosing a topic
Choosing the topic was the hardest part. There were many topics to choose from like sports, travel and trading goods. However, the most interesting was cooking, so I decided for this year-long project I will be researching cooking and making a website about cooking. During the summer I was spending time cooking and baking and found it really fun and enjoyed the experience of cooking and banking. When I was researching for this year-long project I found many interesting articles and websites, mostly about cooking and banking. Some of these article and website are ["Why is cooking imortant"](https://sushantuniversity.edu.in/blog/the-importance-of-cooking-as-a-life-skill/#:~:text=Preparing%20fresh%20foods%20will%20put,of%20your%20family%20and%20friends.)by Sushant, ["Benefits of cooking at home"](https://www.liketocook.com/benefits-of-cooking/) by LikeToCook.com. Both of these articles were interesting on why cooking is important however the article called ["The importance of Cooking"](https://dailyutahchronicle.com/2017/01/16/the-importance-of-cooking/) by The daily utah chronicle. Seeing all the ways that cooking is important I choose to make a website about it. On the way I am learning many skills. 



## Engineering Design Process
I am currently in the first stage of the engineering design process, where my goal is to define the problem. The problem that I hope to solve is to make it easier for people to find a recipe they like and make it the healthy way possible. My next step is to research more about cooking and how to make it easier and faster by using articles and websites. Also asking friends and family on how to make a fast and healthy meal that tastes good.

## Skills

### How to google
When I was googling, I see so many results. What I mean by how to google is that I was able to find the results I wanted to. So I learned to be more specific on what I am googling. Like I search up the importance of cooking and I found the results I wanted too.

### Thinking outside the box

When I was thinking about cooking I felt that it would be really hard to find problems that people face. However I learned to think outside the box and I thought of how most people are lazy but want a good meal. So I put that as the problem I want to solve. Recipe to make a good meal. 




## Summary
Overall, I am really excited to research and make a website about cooking.
