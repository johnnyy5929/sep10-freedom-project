## Content 
For the first and second blog, I talked about the problems with cooking, now I am on the stage of Brainstorm and how to solve these problems. I looked into the past, present and futher of cooking, and found many intersting ideas, I made a time line in where you can see these ideas. For the future I came up with 4 different ideas about how to cook when fast, easy and safe. I also tried solving a problem of how to get food on Mars. 

### Ideas
* A better app

Tells you the recipes 

Tells you the ingredients

Tells how long to cook for

Tastes the food for you

Tells you if you need more or less ingredients

* 3rd printing food

Making a food out of 3d printing

Tells you what you need for the 3d printing

Tells you how long 3d printing food would take 

* An app that tells you all the measurement and temperature

Tells you temperature

Tells you measurements 

You put in a time and temperature that you are cooking it at and it will give you an output telling you what is the temperature inside of  your food.

* A machine to cook for you

You give it ingredients

Tells it what to cook

It makes everything for you and tells you the facts about it like what it is made out of and how much calories it is
