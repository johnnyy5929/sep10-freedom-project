## Content 
For the first and second blog, I talked about the problems with cooking, now I am on the stage of Brainstorm and how to solve these problems. I looked into the past, present and futher of cooking, and found many intersting ideas, I made a time line in where you can see these ideas. For the future I came up with 4 different ideas about how to cook when fast, easy and safe. I also tried solving a problem of how to get food on Mars. 

### Ideas
* A better app

* 3rd printing food

* An app that tells you all the measurement and temperature

* A machine to cook for you

## Time line

Software that is from past to present

### Software
 [Tasty](https://tasty.co/)  
This app allows you to find recipes you like by searching them up  
They also make interesting videos and there is a lot of people who watches those videos  


[Yummly](https://www.yummly.com/)  
This is app for recipes just like tasty   
You can get fast and easy recipes   



Software to hardware of the present 


### Software to hardware:

[3 printing](https://www.3dnatives.com/en/food-3d-printing220520184/)

You might never heard of 3d printing food  
In this website you can see what 3d printing foods is   
You might think is it edible or not some are however I want to make all foods from 3D printing foods edible  

### Hardware of the past to present:

[Thermometer](https://www.thecitycook.com/articles/2015-05-06-the-essential-kitchen-kitchen-thermometers)  
Thermometers helps check the temperature of the food you are cooking  
It is to see if they are the right temperature  

[Scales](https://www.thecitycook.com/articles/2014-12-12-the-essential-kitchen-scales) 
A kitchen scale is for measuring the amount ingredients you need 

[Mixer](https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/reviews/best-stand-mixer)
This is a mixer, it is a thing to mix ingredients 


### For the future:

* A better app  
Tells you the recipes  
Tells you the ingredients  
Tells how long to cook for  
Tastes the food for you  
Tells you if you need more or less ingredients  

* 3rd printing food  
Making a food out of 3d printing  
Tells you what you need for the 3d printing  
Tells you how long 3d printing food would take

* An app that tells you all the measurement and temperature  
Tells you temperature  
Tells you measurements  
You put in a time and temperature that you are cooking it at and it will give you an output telling you what is the temperature inside of your food.  

* A machine to cook for you  
You give it ingredients  
Tells it what to cook  
It makes everything for you and tells you the facts about it like what it is made out of and how much calories it is

I am hoping with these future ideas I can solve the problem of food on Mars or make life for us humans easier with new apps and a machine to do everything for us.
