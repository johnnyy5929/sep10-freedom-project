## Content 
For the first and second blog, I talked about the problems with cooking, now I am on the stage of Brainstorm and how to solve these problems. I looked into the past, present and futher of cooking, and found many intersting ideas, I made a time line in where you can see these ideas. For the future I came up with 4 different ideas about how to cook when fast, easy and safe. I also tried solving a problem of how to get food on Mars. 

### Ideas
* A better app
Tells you the recipes 
Tells you the ingredients
Tells how long to cook for
Tastes the food for you
Tells you if you need more or less ingredients
* 3rd printing food
Making a food out of 3d printing
Tells you what you need for the 3d printing
Tells you how long 3d printing food would take 
* An app that tells you all the measurement and temperature 
Tells you temperature 
Tells you measurements 
You put in a time and temperature that you are cooking it at and it will give you an output telling you what is the temperature inside of  your food.
* A machine to cook for you
You give it ingredients
Tells it what to cook
It makes everything for you and tells you the facts about it like what it is made out of and how much calories it is
