## Content 

As you many know, throughout this school year, we learned many codes, many things, like Bootstrap, Aframe, Html, Css, and Github. All of these things later lead to our freedom project, which was a year long project, where we made a website. MKy website was about the future of cooking. We had to give elevator pitchs and had to present our projects to the class. It was a hard thing to do, but it was fun and I learned many takeaways from these experiment.

### Takeaways from Expo elevator pitch

So we had to do a elevator pitch to judges and they graded us base on the elevator pitch and how well we put our website together. So 

- First this I learned that you should be calm and talk to the judges normally, if you aren't calm you might mess up and say something you didn't want to. 

- Second thing I learned is that you should make eye contact where who you are talking to, the judges like it when they know you are talking to them.

- Third thing is that you should practice your pitch before they come to you, you should be ready so you don't mess up.

- Make sure you tell them everything you want that would help you get a better grade, like show them you tried really hard and that you did something no one else did.

These are my takeaways from the expo elevator pitch.



### Takeaways from in-class presentation

- First thing I learned is that you should talk loud, you should be loud becasue you want everyone to hear you.

- Next thing I learned is you should make eye contact with everyone and not just one person, that one person might not like it. So you shoud look at everyone.

- I also learned that you should slow down sometimes, I felt like I was going too fast which I didn't know until my friends told me, so next time I will try going a bit slower but not too fast as well.
