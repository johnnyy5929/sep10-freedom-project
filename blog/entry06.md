## Content 
Making Mvp was a challenge, when I started I was lost, I didn't know where to start. I had a layout of my wireframe which I used to give me a idea of how to make my mvp. 

## Plan
### Time line

4/15-Make a navbar/start making images

4/16-Finish my formatting

4/17-Add text

4/18-Add Aframe

4/19-Add images to the background

5/1-check eveyrthing

So I made my plan and wireframe and was starting to code everything. I had a lot of challenges and takeaways.

#### Challenges

Some codes didn't work- when I tried to add aframe by using the ````<iframe></iframe>```` code nothing worked at first. and many other codes that IO tried didn't woprk at first which was one challenge.


I didn't understand how to make it look like my wireframe- when I made my wireframe it seems easy but when you start the code, it was hard, I didn't know where everything should go which was anotehr challenge.


#### Takeaways


Try codes until it works for you- When I didn't know something I would try the code until it works, I learned that you need to try new stuff until it works like what I did with for my mvp.

Ask friends for help- If the code still doesn't work evern after trying it you should as a friend for help. Like when I didn't know how the  ````<iframe></iframe>```` worked I asked my friends and they showed me.





## Sources
I wanted to add a robot to my website to show what a robot can do I did this by using Aframe which I learned from ["youtube"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4LEMBjaV9E&list=PL8MkBHej75fJD-HveDzm4xKrciC5VfYuV&index=6) and ["Aframe"](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/javascript-events-dom-apis.html). I also added different fonts which I used the website ["Fonts"](https://fonts.google.com/). After I also used ["Bootstrap"](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/download/) for my component. For my planning i used wireframe [Mobile](https://wireframe.cc/qa15Ss) and [Desktop](https://wireframe.cc/4EpUoN). These are most of the sources I used.


## EDP

I am on step 6 and 7 of the EDP which is Test and evaluate the prototype and Improve as needed. As I said before I wanted to make a robot since the problem I hope to solve is that cooking is sometimes way too hard and us humans are way too lazy sometimes. So I used Aframe to make a robot and now I am on the 6 step and 7 step. Since I need to do some more improvement.


## Skills
