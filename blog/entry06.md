# Entry 6

## Content 
Making Mvp was a challenge, when I started I was lost, I didn't know where to start. I had a layout of my wireframe which I used to give me an idea of how to make my mvp. 

## Plan
### Timeline

4/15-Make a navbar/start making images

4/16-Finish my formatting

4/17-Add text

4/18-Add Aframe

4/19-Add images to the background

5/1-check everything

#### Fonts 

M PLUS 1 Code

Inter

Barlow

So I made my plan and wireframe and started to code everything. I had a lot of challenges and takeaways.

#### Challenges

Some codes don't work- like when I tried to add Aframe by using the ````<iframe></iframe>```` code nothing worked at first. and many other codes that I tried didn't work at first which was one challenge. 


I didn't understand how to make it look like my wireframe- Another challenge was when I made my wireframe it seemed easy but when you started the code, it was hard, I didn't know where everything should go which was another challenge. Like when I want something to go somewhere it doesn't work. For example I wanted my title to go down a bit more but it wasn't working. Also when I added a picture to the background it didn't look right. So making it like the wireframe was a challenge.


#### Takeaways


Try codes until it works for you- When I didn't know something I would try the code until it works, I learned that you need to try new stuff until it works like what I did with my mvp. Like for the background I didn't know how to add a picture but I kept trying and it worked. 

Ask friends for help- If the code still doesn't work even after trying it you should ask a friend for help. Like when I didn't know how the  ````<iframe></iframe>```` I asked my friends and they explained to me how they did the code, so asking a friend is a takeaway from doing the MVP.





## Sources
I wanted to add a robot to my website to show what a robot can do I did this by using Aframe which I learned from ["youtube"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4LEMBjaV9E&list=PL8MkBHej75fJD-HveDzm4xKrciC5VfYuV&index=6) and ["Aframe"](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/javascript-events-dom-apis.html). I also added different fonts which I used on the website ["Fonts"](https://fonts.google.com/). I also used ["Bootstrap"](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/download/) for my component. For my planning I used wireframe [Mobile](https://wireframe.cc/qa15Ss) and [Desktop](https://wireframe.cc/4EpUoN). These are most of the sources I used for making my websites.


## EDP

I am on step 6 and 7 of the EDP which is Test and evaluate the prototype and Improve as needed. As I said before I wanted to make a robot since the problem I hope to solve is that cooking is sometimes way too hard and us humans are way too lazy sometimes. So I used Aframe to make a robot and now I am on the 6 step and 7 step. Since I need to do some more improvement. I finish making my robot, it isn't the best so I need to add more and finish improving everything.


## Skills 

Testing codes- A skill I learned was testing code, I tried many codes until something works as I said before, it was a great skill that will help me later in code. Testing codes you need to be brave and try code which is a skill I learn and that i will develop over time so it gets better.

Researching- Another code I learned was researching which is searching up things that will help with my websites like the fonts, colors, Aframe and etc. Also researching is for me to get the right things that I want which is a really good skill that I learned. So researching is an important skill that I have been developing over months.
