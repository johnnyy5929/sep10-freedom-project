## Content Learning about Software and Hardware of Cooking

So for the first blog entry I talked about why I choose cooking and the problem with cooking, now I finished the Researching part and I am on the brainstorm. When I was reseaching I learned about both hardware and software for cooking. Lets start off with software the first link I found was ["Tasty"](https://tasty.co/) this link is to tasty a food app that gives people imformation on how to make the food they want. Another website for software I found ["Yummly"]( https://www.yummly.com/). This app is just like tasty in which you can use these apps to find recipes you want. However the problems with these apps are it's hard to follow along so I want to make a website that could easier to follow and help us out in the future. In my BHP class I am learning about Mars, so I did some reserch into 3D printing food I found a websites that explains what 3d printing foods are called ["3d printing"](https://www.3dnatives.com/en/food-3d-printing220520184/) in this website it tells us how it hows and I was thinking I can make a website that gives good recipes and has an AI to help us. For hardware I was looking at stuff like ["thermomters"](https://tasty.co/](https://www.thecitycook.com/articles/2015-05-06-the-essential-kitchen-kitchen-thermometers ) which checks the temputure for your foods, maybe for the website it could just guess the temputure so when you don't have one my webiste could help with that. Another hardware was be ["Scales"](https://www.thecitycook.com/articles/2014-12-12-the-essential-kitchen-scales   )
