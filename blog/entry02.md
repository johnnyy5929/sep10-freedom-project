## Content Learning about Software and Hardware of Cooking

So for the first blog entry I talked about why I choose cooking and the problem with cooking, now I finished the Researching part and I am on the brainstorm. When I was reseaching I learned about both hardware and software for cooking. Lets start off with software the first link I found was ["Tasty"](https://tasty.co/) this link is to tasty a food app that gives people imformation on how to make the food they want. Another website for software I found ["Yummly"]( https://www.yummly.com/). This app is just like tasty in which you can use these apps to find recipes you want. However the problems with these apps are it's hard to follow along so I want to make a website that could easier to follow and help us out in the future. In my BHP class I am learning about Mars, so I did some reserch into 3D printing food I found a websites that explains what 3d printing foods are called ["3d printing"](https://www.3dnatives.com/en/food-3d-printing220520184/) in this website it tells us how it hows and I was thinking I can make a website that gives good recipes and has an AI to help us. For hardware I was looking at stuff like ["thermomters"](https://tasty.co/](https://www.thecitycook.com/articles/2015-05-06-the-essential-kitchen-kitchen-thermometers ) which checks the temputure for your foods, maybe for the website it could just guess the temputure so when you don't have one my webiste could help with that. Another hardware was be ["Scales"](https://www.thecitycook.com/articles/2014-12-12-the-essential-kitchen-scales   ) Scales help you find the weight of something, I would like to make the webiste be able to do that for you. The last hardware I was looking at would be ["Mixer"](https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/reviews/best-stand-mixer ) This is to combind ingerdients together to make something. Maybe when applying for my website you get a free mixer for the cooking. When I was doing these reserching I devolp new skills. 



## Engineering Design Process
I am currently in the third stage of the engineering design process, where my goal is to brainstorm the problem and learn how to solve it. The problem that I hope to solve is to make it easier for people to find a recipe they like and make it the healthy way possible. My next step is to research more about how to solve this problem and learn more about coding so It would be easier to understand how to make a website that could help people in cooking and eating healthier than before. This will benefit everyone that likes cooking and wants to eat better.


## Skills 
### Commutation
When I was doing my work, I asked around for people's help, I didn't know that much hardware and software so I asked people. Also when I didn't know what the problem was I asked people what they thought the problem was. It is hard to come up with a way to solve the problem so I asked around as well. So commutation is a good skill to learn and will help me in the future because I know how to communicate easier than before.


### How to find what you are looking for
When I was googling, I saw so many results. It was hard to look for what I wanted to look for, however I away around it, I found that when you are trying to find something you should be more specific with it, what I mean is type in all the thinks you are looking for, this is a good skill that I learned that will help me later when I am googling or researching.
