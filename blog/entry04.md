During this part of the freedom project we had to choose different tools to use and I chose A-Frame. A-frame is a web framework for building VR or virtual reality. It seemed like a cool tool that I can use to make my freedom project better. I been learning to use A-frame, I learned many code that you can use. When I was doing reserch on A-frame I was able to learned code from there website ["A-frame"](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/) and from using youtube videos ["Videos"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktjMCanKNLk&list=PL8MkBHej75fJD-HveDzm4xKrciC5VfYuV)
