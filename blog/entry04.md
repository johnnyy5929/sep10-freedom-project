During this part of the freedom project we had to choose different tools to use and I chose A-Frame. A-frame is a web framework for building VR or virtual reality where you can make 3D model. It seemed like a cool tool that I can use to make my freedom project better. I been learning to use A-frame, I learned many code that you can use. When I was doing reserch on A-frame I was able to learned code from there website ["A-frame"](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/) and from using youtube videos ["Videos"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktjMCanKNLk&list=PL8MkBHej75fJD-HveDzm4xKrciC5VfYuV).

## Code I learned and what it does

### How to install A-frame
* To start doing A-frame in a HTML file you need to add ````<script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.5.0/aframe.min.js"></script>```` inside the head so it should look like this
````
  <head>
    <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.5.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
  </head>
````
After you do this in your body you want to add ````<a-scene> </a-scene>```` which would look like
````
 <body>
   <a-scene>

   </a-scene>
</body>
````
