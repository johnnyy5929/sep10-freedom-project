## Content 
During this part of the freedom project we had to choose different tools to use and I chose A-Frame. A-frame is a web framework for building VR or virtual reality where you can make a 3D model. It seemed like a cool tool that I can use to make my freedom project better. I have been learning to use an A-frame, I learned many codes that you can use. When I was doing research on A-frame I was able to learned code from there website ["A-frame"](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/) and from using youtube videos ["Videos"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktjMCanKNLk&list=PL8MkBHej75fJD-HveDzm4xKrciC5VfYuV).

## Code I learned and what it does

### How to install A-frame
* To start doing A-frame in a HTML file you need to add ````<script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.5.0/aframe.min.js"></script>```` inside the head so it should look like this
````
  <head>
    <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.5.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
  </head>
````
After you do this in your body you want to add ````<a-scene> </a-scene>```` which would look like
````
 <body>
   <a-scene>

   </a-scene>
</body>
````

After we install A-frame we can start coding.

### The basic

* I learned how to add a box
````
 <body>
   <a-scene>
      <a-box>
      </a-box>
   </a-scene>
</body>

````

* To change the properties of the shape you can add color, weight, height, depth and more it will look something like
````
 <body>
   <a-scene>
      <a-box color=""
             weight=""
             height=""
             depth="">
      </a-box>
   </a-scene>
</body>

````

* You can also make a cylinder doing the same thing which would look like

*````<a-cylinder> </a-cylinder>````

Also you can change you can change position 

* adding the code ````position="_ _ _"```` inside the <a-box> or another line of code that you want to change the position for.

* Other stuff you can do is add images, different textures and backgrounds. Which I am still trying to understand but everything has been really peppermint to know. 

  
## Engineering Design Process
I am currently in the fourth stage of the engineering design process, where my goal is to plan a good website and plan how I will use A-frame in my website. The problem I hope to solve is that cooking is sometimes way too hard and us humans are way too lazy sometimes. So I want a website that is easy to use and that tells you all of the recipes. Also on my website you can control and play with a robot online on how to cook things that you want with real life time and action. So you have a website where you can try cooking online first and try the new recipes out.



## Skills 

How to research- I learned how to research what I want to, like how to get the right things to show up. I was trying to look for an A-frame but sometimes some other stuff showed up and also on the website I learned how to look through everything well and get information that can help me. So I learned faster and better ways of researching.

How to tinker- I wasn't able to know what the code fully did so I had to tinker with everything and find out how everything works, so I started using Jsbin and watching over the youtube videos and followed what they did and saw how every code they did worked. So I learned how to tinker with code and make the code better and easier to understand for my notes. So these are the skills I learned when doing the A-frame tinkering and researching.
